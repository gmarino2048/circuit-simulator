/**
 * @brief This is the simulator class responsible for making the updates to the
 *        transistors and wires within the circuit.
 * 
 * The simulator follows a series of basic steps to make updates to the circuit.
 * It maintains a list of wires which need to be updated, and then creates a wire
 * group from each of those wires. Once that is complete, it updates the transistors
 * whose gate side is connected to that wire group. For any of the transistors which
 * change state, the other wire is then added to the list of wires which need
 * recalculation.
